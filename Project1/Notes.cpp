//Check where the player character ends up whilst moving, something is wrong there. 
// - Some randomly big negative numbers appear. (Fixed the updating the axis was in the wrong position)
//Need to Change the movement when it works so it is done automatically (constantly running) 
// - Constantly moving to the right, until the user collides with an obstacle. (Works, but not effectively needs to be upgraded at some point)
//Need to make it so the ground is physical and the player cant pass through it. 
// - Or maybe make it so the player spawns on the ground and when they jump they return to the same point
//Need to add obstacles and collisions. 
// - One for ducking and one for jumping 
// - Wall need to act as removal zones, when something touches a wall it needs to be removed (and if needed replaced)
//Need to add a functioning score aspect. 
// - Points for distance travelled 
// - Points for successfully dodging obstacles?
//Need to make it endless 
// - Looping background and ground, infinity spawning obstacles 
//Need to store the high score and display it on the front screen
// - Saved in an external text file 
//After a playthrough return the user back the the main menu
// - With it mostly being the same, the only difference is that the users score is displayed.
